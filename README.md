# Tic-Tac-Toe-Swift

A `swift` implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe.

The decision making process for the computer moves is taken care by a straightforward `MiniMax` (with and without `Alpha-Beta Pruning`) implementation.

This program was tested on `Fedora 23` and `Ubuntu 14.04` with `swift 2.2`

### How to "play"

The program will ask the player to pick his preferred symbol and will also let the player choose who plays first.

When the game gets going the player will be asked to input the row and column to place his symbol.

The coordinates are represented in the following format :

```
+++++++++++++++++++
| 0,0 | 0,1 | 0,2 |
